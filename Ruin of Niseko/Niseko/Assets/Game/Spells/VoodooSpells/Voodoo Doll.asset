  description: 'Stab a voodoo doll with a needle to instantly damage the closest
    enemy for a reasonably high amount of damage. This spell is quick, but stops
    the player for about half a second to perform the stabbing animation. Bone Restructure:
    telekinetically snap an enemies bone. Essentially a glorified voodoo doll with
    some tweaked stats. Each hit stuns the enemy and it hits up to 3 enemies. Poison:
    throw out a quick needle imbued with poison to deal damage over time to enemies.
    Inflicts a poison effect (weak damage over time).'
